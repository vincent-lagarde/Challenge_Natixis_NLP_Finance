# Challenge Natixis - NLP Finance

This project is part of a challenge aimed at predicting index returns using textual data, specifically central bank speeches. It showcases my ability to apply advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to solve real-world financial prediction problems.

## Context

Central bank speeches significantly influence financial markets by impacting macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, monetary policy, inflation expectations, and credit. This project demonstrates the application of NLP tools to extract insights from these speeches and predict financial market movements.

## My Contributions

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared textual and financial data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the relationship between speech content and financial market behavior.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implemented sentiment analysis models, including Transformer-based architectures.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed machine learning and deep learning models to predict financial market returns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared various NLP approaches to assess their effectiveness in prediction tasks.

## Highlights

- Leveraged state-of-the-art NLP techniques (e.g., Transformers) for financial text analysis.
- Implemented robust pipelines for preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.
- Achieved significant performance improvements over baseline models.
