# Challenge Natixis - NLP Finance

This project was developed as part of a challenge organized by Natixis in partnership with Paris Dauphine University and Ã‰cole Polytechnique. The objective of the challenge was to predict index returns using textual data, specifically central bank speeches, by applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Context

Central bank speeches have a significant impact on financial markets, influencing key macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, monetary policy, inflation expectations, and credit dynamics. This challenge focused on leveraging these speeches to predict financial market movements through the application of NLP methods.

## My Contributions

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared textual and financial data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the relationship between speech content and financial market behavior.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implemented sentiment analysis models, including Transformer-based architectures.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed machine learning and deep learning models to predict financial market returns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared various NLP approaches to assess their effectiveness in prediction tasks.

## Highlights

- Leveraged state-of-the-art NLP techniques (e.g., Transformers) for financial text analysis.
- Implemented robust pipelines for preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.
- Achieved significant performance improvements over baseline models.
